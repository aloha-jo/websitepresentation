    <h1>The Benefits of A Website</h1>
    <p>A business today needs to have a website in order to be competitive. Without an online presence it is difficult to establish trust with a potential customer. However, so many small businesses and especially those that provide a service don’t have one. Many service providers or contractors will still pay for a listing in the yellow pages because they have to “be somewhere”. My position,“that somewhere” should be online, where it has a chance to bring you a return on your investment.

    <h1>Why The Purchase Funnel Matters</h1>
    <p>A business will need
      to capture their attention in the
      stages prior to purchase, if they
      have any hope of being the
      purchase choice. That will likely
      include, searching online, at night
      when businesses are closed.
      Businesses and contractors
      without a website are at a disadvantage as they are not even in consideration during many of the important steps prior to purchase.</p>
